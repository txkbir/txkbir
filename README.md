# Takbir Rahman

**`UCLA Computer Science Undergraduate`**

Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Takbir (thuck-beer). I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at UCLA, set to graduate in June 2026. I'm joining Netflix as a SWE intern in Summer 2025 on the Consumer Product Security & Trust team.

My interests lie in Distributed Systems, Cloud, Security, and AI.

In my free time, I love cooking, collecting (diecasts, LEGO, etc.), comics & movies, and playing Fortnite. Ask me about my diecast collection or my love for my favorite movies/franchises (Cars, Star Wars, Transformers, DC, etc.). One fun fact I love to tell people is that I'm ambidextrous.
